# Project Overview

This project is a Telegram bot for the card game "Bridge".

## Libraries and Frameworks

- python-telegram-bot

## Coding Standards

- Use good coding practices in new code, but do not edit code just for the sake of improving its coding standards.

## Additional Guidelines

- When debugging, investigate and make hypotheses about the potential causes of issues. Add debug logs to verify your hypotheses. Explain your thought process and findings.
- Make small incremental changes (less than 100 lines).
