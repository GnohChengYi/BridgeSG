# BridgeSG

A Telegram bot for [Singaporean bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_bridge).

## Motivation

While playing bridge with [Bridgebot](https://t.me/sg_bridge_bot), 
my friends and I often encountered accidental presses, 
which causes unintended bids and cards.
Besides, it is not often to have 4 players online at the same time.
Hence, I developed this Telegram bot to solve these problems.

## Usage

Message [@MYSGBridgeBot](https://t.me/MYSGBridgeBot) and start playing!
Enter `/help` for more instructions.

ℹ️ The bot works 24h from the 1st to 24th of the month, then rests from 25th onwards. 
It starts working again next month.

## Improvements from [Bridgebot](https://t.me/sg_bridge_bot)

Use inline queries insted of keyboard for actions to avoid accidental presses.
Can add AI player in case less than 4 users are online but want to play a game. 
The AI player is intended to be as strong as an average player.

## Trivia

This bot is developed during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period.
Other usernames including FloatingBridgeBot and SGBridgeBot were considered but they were all taken :(.
